# üí¢ **EXERCISES SECTION**

## This is exercises section. In this folder, you'll find every exercise implementation I've made.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è All of them should be tested in `tests/` folder.</br>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Some of them may be benchmarked in `benchmarks/` folder.</br>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è main files are stored seperatly in `mains/` folder, so we can compile multiple exercises for tests or benchmarks</br>
    without having trouble with multiple main definitions.</br>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è If you want to build and run a specific exercise (ie. its main file), simply set the accoring maccro in `config.mk`.</br>
