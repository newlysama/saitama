# üí¢ **BENCHMARK SECTION**

## This is the benchmark section. In the folder, you'll find some of our exercises implementations' benchmarks.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è In each benchmark folder, you may find a `benchmark_config.hh` file, which allows you to define configurations for the</br>
benchmark to run. This includes a benchmark selection (define or undefine the corresponding maccros, like in `tests/`) and</br>
some parameters setting, such as the size of the data structures we use, etc...</br>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Not all our features should be benchmarked, since some of them do not lend themself to it.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è In each benchmark folder, you'll find my own benchmark results (runned on my PC of course, so value it as it is ü§°)
